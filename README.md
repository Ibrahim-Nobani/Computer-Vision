### Project 1: Image Processing Toolbox

**Overview:**
The Image Processing Toolbox project explores a range of image enhancement and analysis techniques. Tasks include power law transformations, noise addition, mean and median filtering, Sobel filtering, and gradient computation. The project aims to showcase practical applications in image processing, demonstrating how these techniques can be utilized for tasks such as noise reduction, feature extraction, and edge detection.

**How to Use:**
1. Download an 8-bit gray-level image (256x256 pixels) for initial tasks.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the provided report to perform power law transformations, noise addition, filtering, and gradient computation.
3. Understand the impact of various techniques on image quality and draw conclusions from the results.

### Project 2: Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) System

**Overview:**
The Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) System project focuses on the development and evaluation of an image retrieval system. Leveraging color features, including color histogram and color moment, alongside the VGG16 deep learning model, the system aims to efficiently retrieve relevant images based on visual content. The project's specific objectives include system implementation, feature extraction experimentation, system evaluation, and comprehensive documentation.

**How to Use:**
1. Refer to the Content Based Image Retrieval using 3 Techniques folder.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook named "CBIR using Deep Learning+Histograms+Moments".
3. Experiment with different color features and color histograms.
4. Notice the power of deep learning models (VGG16) compared to normal color models.
5. Read the Detailed Report included in the notebook.
